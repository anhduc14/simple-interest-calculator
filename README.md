# Simple Interest Calculator

This project calculates simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example

If:
P = 1000  
R = 5%  
T = 2 years  

Then:

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100  
= 100

## How to Use

Enter principal amount, rate of interest, and time to calculate simple interest.
